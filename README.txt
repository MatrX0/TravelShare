when finalizing:

    -   change Blog to profile
    -   add the shortest path or other bullshit u get from the google's api there
    -   show them as the user presses the buttons
    -   remove User and somehow connect the profile to security's user

    - add restrictions to the google api 



    // use this to save the locations on blogs. Map<Coordinate, List<Blogs>>
    // people can see other peoples blogs based on their coordinates. 
    // the user will first type coordinates or place names, 
    // then once displaying the place, they have a button that when clicked, shows the blogs on that location
    // add a popularity (like system) and show it as a header, when clicked gives the locations with the most starts
    // then, with those locations as coordinates, you can search them on the interactive map.
    // need to implement a directions & distance visual. 
    
    

a websocket for groups and messages
a controller for this shit to work
need to understand how tables work






idk what i wrote above. but this is basically it
    
    - create weather based recommendations & car, hiking, biking and riding

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    - create Groups & Messages via WebSocket

    - create Comments section for public? blogs

    - use "logged in username" for User entity. and make the usernames unique. 

    



                I can use google's api to retrieve data. 
                I edit that data to a more usable format.
                I created Blog entity to save the extracted data, along with a name and personal notes. people can comment on these blogs if they are public   
                
                I will create a GroupChat system so the users can communicate via a WebSocket
                I will add weather based recommendations to the system

                I will use "logged in username" for User entity. and make the usernames unique. 
                I need hiking, biking and riding.
